# 👋 Hi, I'm Aakash Ravte  
### Senior Software Engineer → Applied AI Engineer | GenAI • LLM • VLM • Agentic AI

🚀 Building **intelligent systems at the intersection of Enterprise Automation and Generative AI** 🧠 Turning complex documents, data, and legacy workflows into **autonomous, decision-making agents**

---

## 🧩 Who Am I?

I am a **Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience** building **enterprise-grade Intelligent Automation products**.

Currently, I lead the development of **Document Processor** — a high-scale product bridging **traditional RPA** with **AI-powered automation**. My work involves:
- 📄 **Intelligent Document Understanding:** End-to-end processing of unstructured data.
- 🧠 **ML-Driven Classification:** Seamlessly integrating ML models into production RPA pipelines to automate complex decision-making.
- 👁️ **Computer Vision:** Advanced preprocessing and OCR optimization pipelines.
- 🗣️ **NLP Workflows:** Complex extraction, validation, and semantic analysis.

Now, I am **pivoting deeply into the Agentic AI frontier** to build:
- 🤖 **Autonomous Agentic Systems:** Multi-agent orchestration for complex reasoning.
- 🧠 **LLM & VLM-Powered Apps:** Specialized solutions using Vision-Language Models.
- 📚 **Enterprise RAG:** Scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation using Vector Databases.
- 🌐 **AI Orchestration:** Building production-ready backends using **FastAPI & Flask**.

## 🏗️ What I’m Building Now

### 🔥 Intelligent AI Systems & Orchestration
- **Agentic Workflows:** Designing systems that don't just "chat," but "act" and "solve."
- **VLM-Based IDP:** Next-gen invoice and form extraction using Vision models.
- **Enterprise RAG:** High-fidelity knowledge retrieval systems for private datasets.
- **Multi-Agent Scheduling:** Orchestrating task hand-offs between specialized AI agents.

### 🌐 Applied AI Infrastructure
- **FastAPI/Flask:** Building high-performance API layers for model inference.
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Implementing logging and monitoring for AI reliability.
- **Async Processing:** Scaling AI workloads for real-world enterprise traffic.
